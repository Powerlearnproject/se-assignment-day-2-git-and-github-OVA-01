## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

Version control records change to a file over time to enable revert to specific versions later. GitHub is a great tool because it gives complete visibility to code history via commits. Yes, project integrity can be maintained or investigated using commits to ascertain integrity.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

To set up a new repository on GitHub click on the 'New' Button or the drop-down arrow beside the '+' sign and create a new repository. Name the repository, choose who can see it (public or private), add a README file if needed (repository information), select licence(MIT Licence or GNU preferably) and click create repository button to finalise.

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

A README file is simply information about your repository, to tell people why your project is useful. It is to show the public /visitors more details on your repository or profile. The purpose and function of the project/code should be included in your README file, manage the project expectation, and explain the code of conduct, contribution, licence, and citation. It fosters effective collaboration as it provides all the information needed should anyone wish to collaborate on the same project or sponsor the same project.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

A public repository on GitHub is visible to everyone; however, the level of access to commit has to be granted by you. While a private repository will not be visible to everyone.

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

To commit a file after editing, simply on the commit changes button on the far right corner of your screen, once done add your commit message and description, and choose if you want to commit change/edit to the main branch or a new branch. Once done click the commit change button to finalise. Kindly note that if a new branch is chosen to commit it has to be named, should you wish to maintain different versions. The versions can be merged to the main branch at your preferred time via a pull request.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

Branching is used to maintain different versions of a project, for different important aspects of a project without impacting the main branch. It allows developers to easily work inside of one central code base and isolate changes to maintain stability. Once an edit is done on a main branch, click the commit changes button to save. Upon committing, there is an option to commit to the main branch or commit to a new branch, to create a new branch select commit to the new branch, name the branch and commit. Work can be carried out on the new branch without interrupting/interfering with the main branch.  Once the commit is successful, you can merge the branch to the main branch by clicking on the 'create pull request' button. Once done confirm the merge with the main branch if there are no issues with the merge.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

Pull requests are used to merge different branches of a project to a main branch in a repository. It facilitates review and collaboration as it allows developers to work actively together and seek approval and communication from a repository owner before merge changes can be made from one branch to another. Branches can be merged using the pull request button and approvals can be granted by the repository owner to allow merge with main branch. The steps involved creating a branch, creating a pull request, merging the branch and authorization from the repository owner.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

Forking is creating a remote version of your repository, which does not affect the main branch. Cloning is creating a local version of your repository on your computer which differs from a remote version on GitHub. Forking is a great way to iterate ideas before proposing them to the original repository.


## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

Issues are used to track projects and report bugs on GitHub while project boards help to organise and prioritise work.


## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?

Not understanding the concept and system is a challenge.  A good way to overcome this is through learning the tools and playing around with the system. Also, having an agreed-upon best practice by a team, and providing effective training and support can help resolve common challenges.
